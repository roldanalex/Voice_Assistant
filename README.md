Mily is an AI personal voice assistant service built using Python. It can understand human speech and perform basic tasks requested by the user.

When the user specify the appropriate trigger words, the asistant will execute the user's command.


## Please see below for some of the tasks that this voice assistant can perform:


1. Get the weather of different cities
	
	
		User: Hey Mily, tell me the weather
		
		
2. Open question 
	
	
		User: Hey Mily, I have a question
		
		
3. Translator
	
         
		User: Translate for me
		
		
4. Top 5 headlines in US
	
  		
		User: Hey Mily, tell me the news
		
		
5. Stock price
	
   		
		User: Hey Mily, tell me the Tesla stock price
		
		
6. Ask geographical and computational questions
	
  	 	
		Human: Hey G-One, What is the capital of California? / Hey G-One what is Sin 90?
		
		
## Running on native machine
### Dependencies
* python3
* portaudio (for recording with pyaudio to work)
* [ctcdecode](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode) - for speechrecognition

If you're on mac you can install `portaudio` using `homebrew`

**NOTICE: If you are using windows, some things may not work. For example, torchaudio. I suggest trying this on linux or mac, or use wsl2 on windows**

### using virtualenv (recommend)
1. `virtualenv voiceassistant.venv`
2. `source voiceassistant.venv/bin/activate`

### pip packages
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 

### In-Built libraries required to be imported:

	1.os
	
	2.datetime
	
	3.web browser
	
	4.subprocess



Mily uses third party APIs to predict weather in different cities and to ask computational and geographical questions. 
Free API keys can be generated by creating an account in the following applications.  
	
	Open Weather Map - To forecast weather
	
	WolframAlpha - To answer questions
	

Enjoy =)
